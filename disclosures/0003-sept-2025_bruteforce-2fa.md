Hi, 

Severity : High

Description : The application does not enforce any rate limiting when verifying 6-digit OTPs generated by authenticator apps (TOTP based on RFC 6238). 

An attacker can continuously submit OTP guesses without being blocked or slowed down. Since the OTP space is only 1,000,000 combinations, this makes brute-force feasible. 

Steps to Reproduce:

Log in with a valid username and password for an account that has 2FA enabled. 
When prompted for the 6-digit OTP, script multiple OTP guesses in rapid succession. 
Observe that the system accepts unlimited attempts without any lockout or delay. 

Unlimited OTP guesses can be made with no rate limiting, making brute-force attacks possible. After a small number of failed OTP attempts (e.g., 3â€“5), the system should lock the account or introduce exponential backoff. Impact : High risk of unauthorized account access if an attacker has a valid username/password.

Thanks

> We have some rate limiting in place but it might not be adequate. `Observe that the system accepts unlimited attempts without any lockout or delay` is not true. This would be a nice to have but considering the difficulty to exploit with current rate limits I am not worried, yet I do agree our rate limit logic could be improved and is likely not compliant with RFC 6238.
